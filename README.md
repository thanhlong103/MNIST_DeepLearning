# Deep Learning with VGG16

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the VGG16 architecture on the MNIST dataset. The VGG16 architecture is a convolutional neural network that was proposed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman in their paper titled "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition." The architecture has 16 layers, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset at the time of its release.

The notebook starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. The training and test sets are split, and the training set is further split into a training and validation set. The images are then normalized to the range [0,1].

The OpenCV library is used to process images, and an example of resizing an image is given. A plot of an image from the dataset is shown.

The VGG16 architecture is implemented using the Keras Sequential API. The architecture consists of five blocks, with each block consisting of a convolutional layer, ReLU activation function, and max pooling layer. The kernel size of all convolutional layers is 3x3, and the number of filters of every block is sequentially 64, 128, 256, 512, 512. A dropout probability of 0.5 is used after dense layers. The output layer uses softmax activation.

The model is then compiled using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. The model is trained using the training set and validated using the validation set. The accuracy and loss curves are plotted for both the training and validation sets. Finally, the model is evaluated using the test set, and the accuracy and loss are printed.

In conclusion, this notebook provides a good introduction to the VGG16 architecture and demonstrates how to implement it on the MNIST dataset. The implementation can be easily extended to other datasets and can serve as a good starting point for more complex deep learning projects.
